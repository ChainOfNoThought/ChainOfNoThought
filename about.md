# About This Space

Welcome to my corner of the internet, where thoughts become words and words become stories.

- **GitHub Pages** - Free, reliable hosting
- **Minima theme** - Clean, readable design that puts content first

The focus here is on the words, not the technology. Simple, clean, and functional.
