**A place for a singular soul to yell into the void**

I write here out of the abject terror that I will die having achieved nothing.
And every day I live, I know that I am slowing making my own nightmares into reality.
This is my small rebellion against that fear.

In truth, I found this exercise to be paradoxically difficult - to attempt to leave a mark in the world, or to hide behind the comforting blanket of anonymity. Perhaps such paradox is a good indication of the sincerity of my words, despite their pretentiousness.

I hope that this website serves as a way to share myself with the great beyond. Perhaps I will say something incredibly asinine and destroy my image. Perhaps I will forever hide behind the namelessness of this existence. Perhaps this will serve as a record, and blossom into a beautiful flower for others to enjoy. Or for one other to enjoy, and forget. I do not know.

But I have made my step, and thus you are now here.

Welcome. Thank you. I do hope that I stay in your memory.
