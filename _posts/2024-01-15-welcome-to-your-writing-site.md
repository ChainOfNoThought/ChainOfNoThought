# Welcome to Your Writing Site

Every great writing journey begins with a single word, then a sentence, then a paragraph. This post marks the beginning of your journey.

## How to Add Your Writing

Adding new pieces to your site is simple:

### For Blog Posts and Essays

1. Create a new file in the `_posts` folder
2. Name it using the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-your-title-here.md`
3. Add the front matter (the stuff between the `---` lines at the top)
4. Write your content in Markdown

### For Creative Writing

1. Create a new file in the `_creative_writing` folder
2. Name it whatever you like (ending in `.md`)
3. Add front matter with at least a title
4. Let your creativity flow

## Adding Images

If you want to include images in your posts (remember, just 1-2 per page for simplicity):

```markdown
![Description of image]({{ "/assets/images/your-image.jpg" | relative_url }})
```

Just save your images in the `assets/images` folder first.

## Markdown Basics

Here are the essentials you'll need:

**Bold text** uses two asterisks: `**bold**`

*Italic text* uses one asterisk: `*italic*`

> Blockquotes are great for highlighting important quotes
> Just use the `>` symbol at the start of the line

Links look like this: [Link text](https://example.com)

### Lists are easy too:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Or numbered:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Your Next Steps

1. Edit the `_config.yml` file to add your name and details
2. Update the `about.md` page with your bio
3. Delete this sample post when you're ready
4. Start writing!
