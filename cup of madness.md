God is dead.

It is difficult to understate the profundity of the observation made by Frederick Nietzsche on my worldview. At first, the statement provided me a sneering sense of superiority over those who spent their hours in worship of a god that never spoke, or walked a path that could never be reached. The annoyance and the anger at those who claimed to know truth and virtue, and yet acted with both blindfolds and gags – to state with ignorance that God was dead became an act of vengeance in its small way. But then came nihilism.

It wasn’t some epiphany or an event that brought about nihilism. It would be convenient to claim that my cancer catalyzed these thoughts, but deep down I know that it is, too is a lie. My life is not a story by a bard of legends, but a tale told by an idiot. And thus, there is no dramatic throughline that I can regale – it merely signifies nothing. Only that, at some point in my life I had come across the concept of nihilism and became enraptured by it.

Luckily, I was not predisposed to despair. Likely it was the fortune of being in relative material wealth, surrounded by an endlessly loving and forever supportive family. Thus, nihilism approached me as a question – the one truly serious philosophical problem, if you will. What was the point of it all? From Australia, Korea, and United Arab Emirates, I had the fortune of breaking bread with the followers from the three major religions of the world who claimed to have the answers.

I never for a moment let go of the belief that they held any answers. But their claims were enlightening nonetheless – that the science is the god of the past; that it is absurd to place your faith upon a blind idiot god of chance to have caused the Big Bag; that it is terrifying to exist as a mote of dust, suspended in the sunbeam, against the backdrop of infinite nothingness. Faith was a shield against the traumatic exercise of *momento** mori* – and corollarily, it becomes a torch to hold up against all certainties of the future. God was the god of the future.

Then where does it leave me, the eternal skeptic? The one who is blind to the light of Truth, eyes locked onto total obliteration? Thus, I return to the statement, no longer with red-cheeked smugness but with hollow-eyes terror.

Others latch onto ‘solutions’ – the seductive ambrosia of digital transcendence; the lifelines of romance and companionship bound at wrist and neck; the flip-book distractions of drugs, sex, and violence; the solitary march step of the Ubermensch, or the single drop of water in the ocean satisfied in its eternal cycle. All, another name for ‘Faith’, though they refuse to call it as such. In the end, when all goes cold, and the last moments come, I know I will look onto death and will know fear.

For God, too, has died. And so, I shall join him, in no kingdom nor heaven.

Or so is a conclusion. And now comes a rebellion. “Death, too, is a God, a sacrilege raised by the disciplines of rationality”. As the eternal iconoclast against all solace of finality, I am duty-bound to wander.

This is the failings of the one who worships reason. Like any other fanatic, I kneel to the hypocrisy and repeat the mantra of truth and logic. I am blind – like all tied to this cave called life – seeing the shadows and not imagining the fire beyond the totality of nothingness. Perhaps one day, I shall be free of these chains. Perhaps not, for I cannot imagine being free.

In resignation, terror, duty, and hypocrisy, I raise my cup of madness in memory of God.
