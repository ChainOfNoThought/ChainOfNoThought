excerpt: "Every story begins with an empty page, a cursor blinking in the void, waiting."

Every story begins with an empty page, a cursor blinking in the void, waiting.

The writer sits before it, coffee growing cold, fingers hovering over keys like a pianist afraid to break the silence. The empty page stares backâ€”not judging, not demanding, simply existing in its perfect blankness.

Some say it's terrifying, this whiteness. All that potential, all that possibility, compressed into a rectangle of nothing. But there's freedom in nothing. No mistakes yet made, no wrong turns taken, no characters betrayed by clumsy plotting.

The first word is always the hardest. It breaks the spell, commits you to a direction, however tentative. Once you write "The," you've begun. Once you write "Once," you're telling a story. Once you write "I," you've made it personal.

But here's the secret that every writer knows and every blank page keeps: the emptiness is an illusion. The page was never empty. It was full of every story ever told and every story yet to be written. It held your words before you knew them, waiting patiently for you to discover what was always there.

The cursor blinks. The coffee grows cold. And somewhere between one breath and the next, the first word appears.

And then the second.

And then...

*This is how every journey begins: with a single step into the unmarked snow of possibility.*
