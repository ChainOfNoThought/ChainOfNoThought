We decided to make the final decision of this world through a vote. Symbolically, it was to uphold our values of cooperation. Practically, it was because all five of us had equal – and meagre – chance of succeeding. Still, some stood above the rest. Thus, began my rankings.

The one that should not be considered is myself. Whilst all of us accumulated accomplishments of note in the past decades, my only claim to fame is luck. The survivor from the soulfire disaster. The only survivor in the Last Battle. The one of the only escapees of the Gates. Time and time again, I survived when many of my betters fell. Luck is valuable – more valuable than any spell of a piece of knowledge – but the favor of the fickle goddess is too unreliable to save the world. Hence, I scratched one next to my name.

After me, it would be Midnight Vale, who held the paper neatly clasped within her fingers. The single greatest swordmaster in history; a title which can no longer be claimed by others. Even now, in the wrinkles of old age, her hand gripped the pen with perfect poise. Had she been there in the Last Battle, we may have slain the Demon King. Not that I blame her for her absence, but it does fill me with regret. No doubt it does the same for her. As much as she deserves the chance at redemption, she would be only ten years old by the time the War begins; eighteen by the Last Battle. Old enough for her shot at redemption, but half the world would have already been turned to ash by then. And thus, with terrible sadness, I scratched two next to her name.

After that, it would be the Tyrant of the Moon, who sat hunched with hollow eyes, yet still somehow retaining his regal air. He was no royalty by blood but was more ruthless than any other in history. The son of the mayor who rose to fill the gap of what was left of civilization after the Gates. I had once hated him, then grew to empathize, and now see him for what he is – a broken shell, desperately trying to keep safe what remained of the soft and the innocent. His leadership skills would be invaluable – not to mention his position as a quasi-noble which he could exploit. But there is a hint of doubt – and in his weary eyes I see that he shares this doubt – that he would surely make the optimum decisions, but not miraculous decisions. He may prolong our death but not prevent it altogether. Thus, I grant him a three next to his name.

Then would be Starlight Vox, who seemed to hum an imperceptible tune. For the sole reason that it was their smile that kept everyone sane. It was their food of questionably edible rocks that could bring mirth to this tragic group. Their jokes on history, philosophy, and the afterlife could still bring out the laughter, when others’ gallows humor had long gone stale. They were the genius that finally built the Anchor of Heavens which killed the Demon King. They are the ones who figured out Reincarnation. Who knows what those mischievously young eyes might bring forth, should they be given another two decades? They would have been the brightest star of the new generation. Thus, they certainly deserved at least a four from me.

Then there was her – Open Skies. She was, in many ways, everything that he was not. Charismatic, as the leader of the Band of the Book since birth. Devoted, as the rescuer of the Gates even as the sky fell onto the city. Kind, to always be the one who held the hands of the dying among the burnt ashes. Unbroken, even as she sacrificed her arm and eyesight to use the Anchor against the Demon King. Hopeful, to have pushed us all in these final few years to complete Reincarnation. She was still human – sometimes wrathful, often petty, and deeply scarred; but she was the best of all of us. She had, in secret, quietly begged me for salvation – not of Reincarnation, of death. Weariness – they called it, whispering in hushed tones in the caverns where their lights did not illuminate. The embrace of death was sweeter than the calling of a lover. I know five next to her name was a condemnation to yet another life of suffering. Yet here I was, making that cold calculation – one which I would not make had I not believed in her.

I pass my scratched paper to the Timekeeper. She read my votes and gives me a glance. In that brief moment, I could not help but guess the feelings in her eyes. Perhaps there was a hint of regret, that she herself did not get the chance on the ballot. She would have also ranked high on my list – a genius mage, a prophetic leader, and a fantastic artist. But with her mana core destroyed, she could not maintain the Eternal Soul – she would be born a babe anew, without the knowledge and the memories of this destroyed world. Another roll in this game of destiny, with zero cheats to weigh the dice in our favor. Thus, she volunteered to be the impartial judge, to collect the five pieces of paper written by old, injured, and frail hands for one last time.

I rise from my seat, my robes rustling the silence. I look over the last living beings of this world. All transcendent, having removed mortality from their qualia years ago. Yet, with all the grand spells and history-bending power that encapsulated our bodies, our souls were tired. Some more than others, as Starlight gave him a wink. But even they collapsed back into their seat after giving their vote, their legs having given out after committing to its final act. One by one, the Last rose, then fell into their seats. I give each one a knowing, comforting smile. Whoever was chosen, they would do their best. And I know deep in my heart that they would shine bright and brilliant and save this world from this eternal damnation. And if they ended up here again, in a cavern built by apostates against a religion long made irrelevant, the new group of the Last would try once more. Again, and again, and again, and again.

I was proud to be here, to be counted as the First among the Last.

We hear the rain pour outside, sizzle and pop against the ever-burning soulfire. Under the dim halo of the machine called Reincarnation, the Timekeeper reads and adds the numbers. Such a simple mathematics – simplest we ever had to do, since dragging the mangled parts of ancient gods and the greatest failures of our civilizations, here into this faux shelter. Yet it is the most significant.

The Timekeeper sighs. “There is the clear decision from the votes, with the only one voting against this person being themselves.”

I snicker. I had specifically demanded everyone to give themselves a five – it was easier to make a decision, once self-preservation was guaranteed to the fullest extent. Hope was blinding. Whilst it often guides us to survive, it could always steer us into desperation and selfishness. A five for the self, four for the favorite, three for the hated, two for the hopeful, and one for the desired. It was foolish of me to think that these idiots would listen to me anymore. They were the last of us. The best of us.

“Well then, who is our lucky winner?” I urge the Timekeeper with the sense of finality. The last joke for the world. Then I see their faces once more – and realize that they are all looking to me.

“You, Polaris Umbra.” The Timekeeper smiles, and so does the rest. The Moon. The Midnight. The Sky. The Starlight. “You were always the lucky one.”

…

It is said that when a baby is born, they cry as they first face the truth of existence. The trauma of cold air in the lungs and piercing light in the eyes. The sudden removal of warmth of the mother’s womb. The strange noise of languages and faces and smells. The falling sand of the time. The babe does not understand any of it, and thus they have only one option – to cry, to declare, to breath and declare, even if it were to be through the most fleeting of moments, that they were alive.

At least, that was the reason why I cried as the babe born anew.

Or so I think. In truth, it is difficult to think – the sensations and sounds are overwhelming, and I have no faculties to describe any of it. None of the countless memories and experiences of my soul could compare to this daunting situation. My eyes were seeing, but they yet had muscular control to focus on the images. My ears were ringing, but there was yet the space in my head to recognize the basic patterns of sound. The only thing I could recognize was the warmth on my skin. Something comforting, something that would ever be my home.

Mother.

The word got stuck in my throat. Moreso than everything else. The tears of fear of this baby body of mine soon became mixed with tears of longing.

Mother.

I had not had the chance to say goodbye. We had parted with a smile, and a promise to return. The last letter I sent her was one of bravado and complaints of creaturely comforts. By the time I had returned to what was left of home, it had already been burnt to ash. I did not know when she had died, nor if she was buried with grace.

Mother.

She was here, holding me in her chest.

Then there was another warmth. Same, yet different. It takes me a while to process what it is. A long, long forgotten strength that was taken from me far too early. Every now and then I would imagine what his hands would have felt like to hold in my grasp. Those moments were fleeting, and became fleeting as the time marched on, but they never faded completely. A man with whom I had very little memory of but still felt the burning fire of longing towards.

Father.

He laid his hands on by back. And it was then I knew.

I was home.

…

Being a baby meant sleeping. The body ached considerably, and even breathing was a chore. And whenever my consciousness was open, they were running overdrive trying to attach names to colors, sounds to faces, warmth and coldness to ideas. I had thought I had some practice with this – I had reconstructed my body from scratch several times after the End of the World, to the point where relearning how the heartbeat worked had become routine and almost formulaic. But this was something all too new. It was *growth*, not restoration. Of doing something new and going boldly into the future. I only realized now how incomparably more difficult that was.

This particular baby was also afflicted with two grave maladies.

The first was my premature birth – only by three weeks, but I had always been diminutive in size because of it. That meant that both mother and father – and a third person whom I realized must be my nurse – were busy around the clock to ensure my survival. I had to be moved from side to side to prevent myself from choking to death. I had to be lifted up and cleaned on the regular. I had to be fed, wrapped in a warm blanket, and checked time and time again for my pulse. I did not even attempt to accommodate my caretakers – the body operated primarily on instinct, and I did not have the capacity to control my muscles.

The second was my Eternal Soul, which demanded action, even now. My growth as a mage had to begin now, if I had ever hoped to catch up to the genius of this coming era. Not that it was realistically feasible as my heart was physically too small, but I tried anyway. It an idea from the Timekeeper – to build up the mana core from birth and become unrivalled in the use of magic. Take the ideas of young apprentices and slave mages to their logical extreme. Combining the knowledge of a last survivor with the body of a baby, we might reach heights of magic never thought attainable. Unfortunately, none of us would have ever imagined how difficult it would be for a baby to open their mouth to cry, let alone forcibly push many through our blood.

Thus, I remained small under the pressure of these two illnesses. Healthy, very much so. I had an insatiable desire to eat, grow, and breathe. But small, nonetheless.

I open my eyes and I see the face of my father. I recognized his existence from day one, but it is only now that I have the capacity to how he looked. Short, brown hair and a stubble beard. Thick eyebrows that framed his wide yet sharp eyes. A relatively small nose, and cheeks that had hollowed with lack of sleep, presumably due to my birth. Even after my eyes learnt to focus, I did not recognize how he looked – the man was but a fuzzy haze in my memory and instinctively unfamiliar. It took me a while to convince myself to label this face with that of my birth father. But looking at him again now, his half-asleep form against my crib, I see that he does, indeed, look like me.

My mother also comes into view. She is also clearly tired, with weary bags beneath her eyes. But she is very much how I remember her – curly black hair, round hazel eyes, and a smile that was much wider than it seemed possible. I do fondly recall fooling around with her unusually large mouth when I was young. Or, will fool around. Hmm.

I stretch out my stubby arms the best I can, and she picks me up, rousing my father from sleep.

Even in their tiredness, they still hug me dearly – and carefully – and warmly.

Will. Will indeed.

I flail and flounder and then drift off to sleep once more.

…

I frankly don’t know what to do. What is the *ethical* thing to do. It is a question that no human ever had to consider before.

How do you respond to a peek-a-boo?

Perhaps a child of six months of age would love this kind of game. I recall playing with the Last Baby of the World in the exact same manner, taking on the role of an Uncle till his untimely yet wholly predictable early death. From those memories I could reasonably fake the reactions a baby my age would give. But then I would only be humoring my parents – condescending and demeaning them. Smiling towards my parents and crying when I couldn’t even lift my upper body were almost instinctive reactions, so those actions were not fake. But looking at my father now, attempting to make funny faces to the best of his ability, I could not help but imagine the repercussions of my actions.

I had resolved early to tell my parents about everything as soon as they would reasonably listen. That would mean giving them hints – a knowing look here, an unusual knowledge there – that the baby in their arms was a little more than a mere baby. But would it be so bad, to let them feel the joys of a normal parenthood, before letting them know the weight of the future? I do not know – and I do not think there is any answer, other than mine own, right now.

These thoughts are, of course, incomprehensible to the child, and I simply scrunch my face with frustration. My father quickly opts to tickle me instead. The laughter is instinctive, and his smile is comforting.

Yes, it would not hurt to let them know peace, if not just a little longer.

…

“Mama”

The shriek of delight is the best sound I have ever heard in my life.

“Did you hear him speak?” Mother slaps father – hard – on his shoulders.

He doesn’t seem to mind. “I did!” He shoves his face into my field of vision.

“And me?”

The ‘p’ sound is still a little difficult for these muscles, so I manage a meagre “Ah!”.

I had heard the final trumpets of the Church, the choirs of the grandest ceremonies, supposedly the music closest to the Heavens, ring throughout the Gate in its final hour. I knew that their statements were aggrandizements, but now I have solid proof: the music closest to the Heavens is the laughter of the parents, hearing the first words of the child.

I do my best to speak with them as they excitedly point to various objects around the room. Clean and large, not lavishly decorated but still affluent. I was the son of a well-to-do book merchant. Not that I remembered much of this childhood. But nonetheless, I try to push through the rapidly onsetting fatigue and name the various objects. Mother. Clock. Father. Bed. Mother. Book. Father. Window. Light. Mother. Father. They really like pointing to themselves, and their happiness is contagious. I hoped that they would recognize that no baby that was eight months old should already have such an extensive vocabulary, but I think they are too busy smiling to realize it. Either that, or my mouth muscles aren’t strong enough to make distinguishable sounds beyond “mooh!” and “ah!”.

It was most likely latter.

Soon, they are called away to work, and I am left alone in my crib. There is a mobile above my head, which I mostly ignore. Instead, I focus inwards, into my blood, into my heart. The mana paths are growing nicely. Or more accurately, they are growing in the way I intended them to.

Lady Midnight was the one to pioneer this technique – cell-wise core generation, she called it. An insane idea to generate a mana core based not on the flow of blood, but on individual cells. A rejection of a thousand years of wisdom by brilliant minds over the ages who commanded mountains and raised the seas. Insane and revolutionary – there was little difference for the geniuses, and her prowess of the body was sufficient proof of the technique’s effectiveness. Among the last survivors, it had taken me the longest to master the technique, and I could only do so after destroying my body and rebuilding it again from scratch. Remember – she had said – that we were the World itself in our own bodies. Whoever would be chosen to return would have to go beyond that. The World itself, in this tiny body that could barely collect an iota of magic? But the journey of a thousand steps…

Ah. I need to practice sitting up.

…

I have my hands on my chin, deep in thought. An old, *old* habit of mine. I had thought that it would be strange to see a child taking on this pose, but it seemed that my parents found it endearing, so I did not refrain from doing so.

I am trying my best to give them the clues, but it falls on deaf ears.

*He is so strong; he can already stand!*

*He seems to have affinity with mana!*

*He already knows so many words!*

I am barely eighteen months old and am the envy of other neighbors and other mothers. Even nurses and doctors seem pleasantly surprised to have witnessed my growth. None of them seem to suspect that I may be nearly a century old survivor from the apocalypse, reborn to save the world. In their place, neither would I.

What has me worried now, however, is the protruded belly of my mother. I *did not* have a sibling. So why the sudden change? Perhaps it was the fact that I was such a nice baby to have. Even though my faculties were barely in place, I was an angelic baby. Weaker than most, perhaps, but no less healthy. So, it must have meant that my parents found the courage to try for a second child.

A wildly exciting prospect – a change in the course of history. But too soon, perhaps. If the world deviated too much from my knowledge, then I could not control it.

The wild ethical questions that flood my mind – not the mind of the little boy, no. The little boy literally fainted himself to sleep whenever he is trying to think too hard. But the questions nonetheless ruminate in my Eternal Soul; questions about the creation of life, of people who may exist who could not, of foresight, sacrifice, tyranny, and survival.

And, right on cue, I feel my little body slumping forward with fatigue. Questions for later, perhaps.

…

A sister?

I don’t know what that means. Not the boy, and certainly not the soul. I reach out, and she grasps my hand. I know this is mostly out of instinct – it had not even been two years since I was born, too. But I also remember the warmth. The chaos, the awe, and the warmth. I wonder if she recognizes my warmth.

I hope she recognizes my warmth.

“Her name?” I ask.

“Lyfe.” Father answers. “Your sister’s name is Lyfe.”

I nodded. “Good name.”

My parents look at each other with a curious expression on their face.

“Come on, Ort. Your mother needs rest.”

I nodded and gently shake my hand loose. The little warmth of her fingers cling to the edges of my skin. I waved the two of them goodbye and let my father pick me up to carry me out of the room.

“What do you think about your sister?”

It’s a good question. I don’t quite know how I feel about it. She will have quite a life ahead of her. I had an obligation to prepare her for it. But that was the logistical side of the Eternal Soul, doing the calculations in my head on how to best train a child for the war ahead. The ethical side raises its little protest, telling me to let her grow up kind and happy, but it doesn’t find much purchase. But then the emotional side – the thoughts and feeling of this little boy clinging to his father’s arms right now?

“Good.” I reply, honestly.

“Will you be a good brother?” He asks with a smile. He started giving me this smile recently – a smile tinged with concern, curiosity, and the tiniest amount of fear. I think he has finally realized it, even if he doesn’t know it consciously.

“More than good.” I reply, drawing laughter from my father.

Yes. I needed to be more than that. Or so I think, as my father sets me down among my toys of colorful balls and holed boxes. The childish brain takes delight in seeing things fit together and moving my hands and arms in ever more complex ways. The Eternal Soul screams with boredom. I would have opted to read books, but the poor brain burnt itself out very rapidly trying to comprehend the squiggly lines called words at the speed of my thoughts. So, I mostly found entertainment elsewhere – mainly in observing how the body grows into ever increasing complexity. The mana remains elusive – the damned cell cores are stubborn in their formation. But the brain begins to take in greater and greater ideas and senses. Recently, it is the tongue and the nose that begins to understand the salty, the sweet, and the savory. The spice in the air, the alcohol in the wines, the aroma of the baking goods. Not that any of it is within my grasp – I am still relegated to soft fruits and vegetables and overcooked meat. My dear and overly responsible parents only feed me things that my tiny teeth can handle. It will be a while yet before I can reacquaint myself with my addiction to alcohol.

And with that, I find myself, drifting off to sleep, having already spent the quota of thoughts that this little body could handle. But as I drifted off, I caught the glimpse of my father, who rested his hands gently on my chest.

“Son, I love you.”

I smile, in both warmth and sadness, realizing that this was the first time he spoke to me with the hidden meaning. He knows. He knows. He knows that I understand the hidden meaning.

My childhood had truly come to an end.

…

I had never given it much thought before, but ‘getting along’ is not optional for us humans.

It has been a few months since mother had begun to place me with other children in the neighborhood. We gather at a neighboring runemith’s place, for they were the richest amongst the small community of merchants that my family found themselves with. There is another boy of my age – recently turned two, so a month younger than I. However, most others are older, between the ages of three to four. The five- and six-year-olds get to play outside, their bodies filled with enough energy to run laps around the poor parents and servants that try to keep up. Here, in this room filled with soft clay and rounded wooden toys, young children learn to play with each other, share objects, try to figure out each other’s intent, emotions, and feelings. We are very quickly taught that hitting others is bad, playing together is good. Stealing things are bad and helping each other is good. If you mess up, you have at least a dozen pairs of eyes that look at you with critical eyes.

They used to stare at me, the silent one. Not that I have not done anything particularly wrong. I just didn’t feel the need to play with others. But, egged on by the concerned eyes of my mother, I had to begin cooperating. Conforming to what a child would do. So right now, helping the girl – Alie – stack blocks. I handed her a block about the size of her hand, just the right piece that should help her add the next layer. She pushes it away and says, “bigger one!” I look around and do find a bigger one – it clearly won’t fit. But I handed it to her anyway. She tries to put it on top, quickly realizes that it won’t work, and pushes it aside to pick up the original block I gave her. But instead of placing a new layer, her attention has focused on a new construction project.

So now I am left with a half-finished tower of balsa wood for myself. I carefully move around the shoddy construction, seeing how I might improve it, before being rudely interrupted by one of the older boys – Ren – decides to crash himself through it.

The tower falls.

The tower falls.

The tower falls.

The tower falls.

The tower falls.

I collapse as the memory floods forces itself into my mind. The Wall, the last bastion of civilization – the pathetic yet grand in its weak defiance. The tower fell.

The tower fell before my twenty seventh birthday. The Last Battle, after my twenty sixth. The Demon King crossed into this continent when I was twenty-two.

At most, I have two decades left.

I wake up again in my bed, and the first I see is that of mother. Upon meeting my gaze, she immediately breaks down in tears, her swollen cheeks red from anguish.

“Oh, Ort! My Ort…”

She does not need to say much. Her sobs and cries speak for her. My father also reaches down to hug me, holding in his emotions.

It had been such a long time since the tower fell. I remember seeing the cries of despair of the last mothers and fathers, daughters and sons. I remember seeing – but not feeling. Whether by erosion or weariness, I do not wish to remember.

But I feel it now. The swelling of heat in my face. The halting air in my throat. The baby boy, burdened with what must never be. So, I cry. In my parents’ arms, I cry. I clench my arms around them. I let the emotions drown me in sorrow.

I learn to cry once again.

…

I have my daily routine now. Wake up, do stretching with these short, stubby body. Then sit, close my eyes, and meditate, feel the magic tug and pull through my cells. Then I stand up again, grab a pillow, and drag it across the room to the crib. The little thing had stolen my throne, and the three-year-old was vengeful. Then I throw the pillow against the side of it, reach forward, and place my hand on the girl’s hand. She grabs it softly.

Lyfe.

I still don’t know what a ‘sister’ is. But I made sure to make her suffer.

I push my mana through my hand and into her palm. Slowly, trickle by trickle. Barely enough to rustle even the baby hair on her cheeks. But she could surely feel it. A one-on-one session on magical acuity with one of the last transcendent survivors of the world? There was no education that could even come close. I move to a different part of her body every day. Left leg. Right arm. Chest. Right leg. Left arm. Head. At first, she’d squirm in discomfort—each day, I’d return to find myself banished, again and again. But I always found my way back. This was not negotiable. Seeing that I meant no harm, they – very cautiously – left me be.

Now though, she seemed to have gotten used to it. And her relative comfort makes me a little annoyed. But my Soul suppresses the urge to do something dumb and force the boy to keep going.

She would need all the preparation she could get.

“What are you doing with your sister again, Ortus?”

I turned my head and saw mother enter the room. As of late, a cloud of worry has always fogged her expression. Likely something to do with the fact that her firstborn was a silent kid that often fainted in fits of terror, who spoke too many words yet too infrequently. The ‘strange kid’.

I do what I can to accommodate and play the part, but there is only so much I can do. The years tick by as I still grow, before anybody sees me as more than just the boy that beats the drums out of curiosity.

Seventeen years left.

My father soon enters the room. He, too, is tinged with worry, though his worry is tempered with an instinctive forewarning.

Today, however, it is also mixed with another expression – dread?

I frown as another woman enters behind him – a purple dress and wide hat. She wears a heavy perfume which makes my face scrunch up with disgust, as I have not yet mastered the craft of hiding expressions.

“Protect my sister.” I reply, carefully eyeing up the stranger. I have learnt to work with the limited recognition of this body – so I could tell that she was tall, had skin that looked a little off, and had a single ring that hung from the top of her hat. Interpreting it again, she was a witch from the Association, who wore make-up even when entering a baby’s room, and was a low ranker who was willing to enter a merchant’s house. The child would not have discerned these nuances, but the Soul informs him that his parents likely spent a lot of money to bring her here.

“Aren’t you a strong little boy!” The woman laughs. Mother swoops down to pick me up – I am getting too big to be picked up very easily – and I manage a glance at my sister. She is sleeping soundly.

“He is Ort, madam.” My mother bows.

“Nice to meet you, Ort.” The woman smiles as she plops herself down on the chair. Another person – a young, barely adolescent kid – enters the room and hands her a large leather bag, from which the witch withdraws a roll of paper, wrapped tightly in rune inscribed ribbons. It unfurls into a mat with a large circle in the center, and many more runes written radially out.

I quickly switch my brain into full power to read the runes – it is a relatively simple diagnostic tool, measuring the attunement to magic. It also detects low level curses or other anomalies that would not be picked up by a doctor. Even wraiths – though I see that her spells in detecting wraiths are extremely primitive.

Even this substandard test would have cost my parents half a year’s worth of food.

“Please, stand here,” the woman lays down the paper on the floor points to the center of the circle. I look at my parents, who nod solemnly. I slowly comply, gingerly stepping onto the circle, moving slowly as my childish wonder lust excuses my sluggish behavior – giving myself time to calculate.

What to do now?

I could very easily light up this entire room with this detector – my mana cells, whilst still not satisfactory, were more than ready for this task. Being identified as a prodigy and rising the ranks of magehood would certainly fast-track me to political power. Meeting Starlight early on and building connections with those who had the world under their fingertips – I had thought about this as the potential path forward. And, in truth, this was likely the most efficient path forward.

But there was one small downside dissuaded me from this path – the insularity. Being an ‘Islander’ was a slander, a weak attempt of defiance by the common folk against the mages. I had not understood this resentment until much later, when the famines had begun killing double the number of the dead from the battlefield. Even as the rot filled the air, the ‘Islanders’ were safe and hiding – and starving in private to save face. It was then that I too began calling the mages; ‘Islanders’.

No common folk would follow an Islander.

There were other reasons, too—strategic ones: the need to keep the silos full in war, to give face to a hero, to satisfy my own arrogance, perhaps. But if I'm honest, the real reason was simpler: A dream of golden fields. Of grass, not soulfire, riding the wind from the great plains.

“Don’t be shy and just relax.” The woman said as she loaded the edges of the runes with mana stones. “Try to close your eyes and think of a ball. Be as detailed as you can. How big is the ball? How heavy? What color? Is it cold? Or hot? You don’t have to answer me but do imagine it as much as you can.”

Conceptualization. Step one of magic.

I close my eyes and calculate. Not the ball – no! I wouldn’t dare risk repeating that timeless exercise. I’ve become too good at it. Instead, let’s think up of… plate made from noodles... yes… slightly slimy, little lighter than a ceramic dish, glistening… with smell of tomatoes, held together by being… frozen, then no smell actually… I’m hungry now.

A passing interest from the mages would still be desirable – a stamp on the forehead, that this child has possible potential. Not enough to rush. Just… keep him in mind.

“Okay, done! Congratulations, kid! You do have talent for magic!”

I open my eyes and look at my parents, whose worried looks have not disappeared.

“So…”

The witch looks down at the runes, which are glowing here and there to indicate my attunement. I read it from afar to judge how well it works and am surprised at how inaccurate the readings are.

“No black residue, nor a trailing rune.” She says, “Hmm… rare indeed. Interesting. His levels aren’t too bad, especially since he is so young…” She looks up at my parents and shakes her head. “Ah, my apologies. Your son is not cursed, nor is he suffering from a haunting.”

A momentary question comes to my head – am I not haunted, in the literal sense?

“But it seems like he is attuned to an unusual variation of magic; Mind.”

The whole attunement theory would be thrown out by Starlight later, but I did not bother correcting her.

“Mind mages are quite rare, but it is known that they often become overloaded with other people’s emotions and thoughts without proper training. His mana levels are not too bad for his age, so that’s probably why he was having seizures.”

Not a bad conjecture based on what she knew, though it was overly confident.

“Here, I will prescribe you the lode pills. This should help calm him down.”

At this, I feel a sudden urge to punch this woman in her privates. Lode pills! Mana suppressants! Just because I am not a noble!

My first thought goes to Lyfe.

Lode pills ruin a mage before they even begin. She was lucky they couldn't test her yet. It was imperative that she be kept under strict supervision *away* from these Islanders.

“Thank you! Oh, thank you!” My parents both say as the mage packs up her stuff. I cannot quite read their faces, but it feels that they too have picked up on my anger. But they don’t let it show – they make their living with their faces, after all. And my mother – she is clearly conflicted. Is not the health of the child the most important?

The witch leaves, and my parents both give me a hug. A small vial of small red pills remains on the desk, forcing the three of us to stare at it for a while.

Eventually, I am the first one to speak.

“I am not eating that.” My mother opens my mouth to complain, but I stop her. “I am fine, and that witch is stupid.”

My father looks at my mother. My mother looks at my father. They both nod. My father picks it up and shoves it deep into the drawer.

I am deeply grateful.

I also memorize where in the drawer it is hidden – I will have to fudge its tracer soon.
