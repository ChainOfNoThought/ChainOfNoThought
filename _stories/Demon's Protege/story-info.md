What is evil? Such is the question posed by the Demon of the Red Blade as he reawakens from the centuries of slumber. But most do not know of his return - instead, they are concerned of crisis of their own times. Lange Whitten is one such individual, chosen to be a Hero, to carry on a story of triumph and faith into the future. Chosen by the Eternal Garden. Chosen by the Hallow. Chosen by the Demon. Willing or not, he must provide an answer to the question which will shape how the world will end.
