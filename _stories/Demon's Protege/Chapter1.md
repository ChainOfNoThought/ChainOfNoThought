Lange took a step back and squinted, taking in the form of the dress in hazy, diffused streaks between his eyelashes. The boy chosen as this year’s Flower King was on the lanky side, so the resting silhouette of the dress needed to appear fuller to compensate for his figure. So far it seemed to come along nicely, with the pressed edge of the petal sleeves and leafy tails holding their shape well on the wooden mannequin. The only slight issue was the blade.

Lange picked up the softwood stick and pinned it against the hip of the dress. It dangled straight and true – discordant against the curves and flows of the dress. He berated himself for having forgotten about the prop till now. Should he inquire the blacksmith to go with a saber instead? Or perhaps the blade should be always carried, and have decorations on the scabbard?

He twirled the stick, then planted it firmly in front of him like a short banneret of a knight. The length of the blade was fine – a little short, perhaps Empire style? He hoisted up the weapon and brought it up to his chest. It was difficult to tell without the weight of steel, but the reach it had as he swung the weapon – and how easily it reacted to the twist of his elbow – he was certain that the blade was of the slashing sort. Then, it would fit a lighter armor. With this reach – the outstretched tip of the weapon barely reaching past the mannequin – there wasn’t sufficient room for a sweeping maneuver. It demanded deftness, and edge. With a momentary glint in his eyes, the wood swung with a satisfying woosh across the non-existent neck of the dress. Surely, this frilly dress would not go well with such a swift weapon.

“Nice moves,” came a clap from the doorway.

“Shit-!” Lange swung around with the blade clutched to his chest. The tall man ducked his head slightly as he entered the room. “Leaf!”

“You’re gonna need more practice if you’re planning on regicide.” The elf chuckled.

“When in the hells did you get here?” Lange reached out for a half-hug and received a back-cracking full hug instead.

“Good to see you swinging, Lange. I arrived in town around noon and came straight here. I let myself in from the back.”

“You didn’t see Mum?”

“No, but she said hi from the front. I think she is dealing with a customer right now.”

“Ah.” Lange glanced out the window. The rejuvenated spring SUN was showering the streets of Kradia with a delightful shine, enticing more people outside to enjoy the dawning return of warmth. Even though he himself preferred the comfort of his attic workshop, a change of fashion was always appreciated – both for his eyes and for their coffers. “Staying for the Blooming Festival?”

“Maybe longer.”

“Hmm?” Lange looked back at his friend. There was no way that he could tell what season it was by looking at him – he always wore the same drab overcoat that reached down to his knees, lined with numerous pockets that were held down with buttons. Matching buttons that formed a grid pattern – the only sense of fashion salvageable from that coat, resuscitated by Lange’s pleading the year prior. At least his hair was relatively well-kept this time; it probably meant that he was in civilization in the past month. “Bought anything for me?” He grinned and held out his hand like a child waiting for candy.

“Not this time.” Leaf grinned back. But it was a stilted grin. Knowing Leaf’s history, Lange knew to change the subject, so he awkwardly trotted over to the mannequin and held out the arms of the dress.

“What do you think?”

Leaf looked up and down the greenish-gold overalls and nodded approvingly. “Looks expensive?”

Lange laughed, “Mayor’s son is this year’s Flower King.”

Leaf raised his eyebrow. “Nepotism, huh?”

Lange winced, Wrong subject!

“No no. The kid’s actually quite nice. Don’t think he knows how to swing a sword though.”

Leaf frowned, “How old’s the kid?”

“Fourteen?”

Leaf opened his mouth briefly, before nodding with his chin and averting his gaze. This time, it seemed like *he* was the one who had broached the wrong subject. Lange felt bad for having made him feel bad, and he was rapidly running out of ideas on how to continue the conversation. Thankfully, his mother had divine timing to save him in his stead.

“Lange! Look after the shop for me. I’m going out to get some groceries. Leaf, you’d better wash up before messing up my house!”

“Yes, ma’am.” The two of them shouted towards the doorway. The faint sound of chimes of the door swinging open and shut rang from the floor below.

Leaf shrugged. “Why does she assume I’m always dirty?” He mumbled.

Lange shrugged as he reached for his vest, “Not always… but last year?”

Leaf smirked, “Fair enough.”

The two of them lumbered down the staircase – alone, Lange barely had the weight to creak the floorboards, but the two of them made a rather homely groans of wood from their old house. Leaf patted him on the shoulder before heading towards the back of the house to wash himself. Lange walked down the short hallway and stood behind the door that separated their house and the shop. He checked himself in the small mirror that hung from the back wall; combed his hair to one side with his fingers, straightened his vest, and pulled up his pants, then opened the door. The waft of fabric and wool enveloped him as he stepped into their small family shop. Even though it was theoretically enough for ten people to crowd in, the slightly oversized counter, the fitting table against the wall, and the display mannequins near the windows took up majority of the space. The dignitaries occasionally complained about the cramp spacing, but this was usually replied by his mother’s sharp jabs about them being too fat to fit into a room with more than a servant per limb carrying their weight – and that usually was enough to shut them up. Lange was always glad that their reputation was already good enough for the customers to come to them instead of the other way around. Otherwise, they would have gone out of business long before he had grown up. The few that still came to the shop to complain were those that wanted to gloat at his mother, but even they knew to stop when she reached for the stick.

Lange spent some time cleaning up. Not that there was anything that needed done – his mother was far more meticulous than he was, and his ‘cleaning’ would only make things messier. But he still ran his hands over every surface to brush off the miniscule strands of string that had settled down. A well-meaning flick off the cloth here and there and straightening of the dress on display. He heard a carriage roll by, and Leaf yelling about going to sleep in the guest room. Lange took a moment at the center of their shop and breathed in the warm, slightly dusty air. He grinned.

Lange then sat down behind the counter – making sure that his head was still visible from outside – and pulled out his sketchbook from behind the accounting papers. He flickered past till he reached the order labelled two-two-five and began to re-examine the specifications and dimensions written on the paper. The sword was, in fact, written very clearly next to the left thigh, but he still could not fathom as to why he had completely forgotten about it when he transferred the drawing upstairs. Well, he had an excuse – he worked on *clothes*, not *weapons*. But nonetheless, the order was the comprehensive set; he should have been careful from the very beginning.

From the corner of his eye, he saw a shadow approach the door. He put on his best smile as the door swung open, and a man in dark entered. The billowing folds of his cloak muffled the bells attached to the swinging doors. The man’s form was encased tightly in a black woolen top, framed by the striking white trim of his cloak. Lange recognized his fashion to that of ancient Empyrean style, but black and white color scheme was rarely – if ever – favored by the boisterous High Men of Mia. Perhaps he was military; his methodic, unhurried scan through the room certainly reinforced that impression.

Lange silently straightened his jacket then carefully stood up from behind the counter. “How can I help you?”

The man’s eyes locked onto his own, and Lange felt the immense pressure of cold steel pushing against his eyes. He had experienced intense glares before – the deep swirling ones of his mother, the sputtering ones from superstitious old men, and even the calm yet murderous ones of the Botanarch. But this… bever before had he felt so… non-existent, barely a discoloration against the backdrop of the textureless room. He squirmed, as though to prove to himself that he was, in fact, alive.

Then the man’s surprised him – a slight bow, a relaxation of the shoulders; the white trim of his cloth creased from blades into folds as the man gave his Empyrean greeting.

“Greetings. Does the Thirty-Seventh Hallow-Bearer dwell here?”

Lange knew the names of all thirty-six Heroes, and the stories of the notable ones. And despite her dismissal of them, he was especially aware of the thirty-sixth Hero’s journey. Yet, despite being technically the correct term to use, calling his mother a Hallow-Bearer felt derogatory. But thirty-seven? A mistake?

He risked a glance again at the man’s attire. The wool was well-maintained, but the seams were neither sleek nor tight – worn with much use. His pants – slightly loose khaki canvas that narrowed ever so slightly near his boots – were flecked with dirt and faded under sunlight. A tightly wrapped grey sash around his waist neatly packaged his travelling attire together, as well as holding in place a long, bandage-wrapped stick that undoubtedly held the shape of a not-really-hidden sword of some sort. The man was not lacking in money, but certainly not rich enough to have a servant for his clothes. The man fresh off his travels, likely from the colder north considering the overbite sash wrap that was fashionable there. The man cared not for ornaments, charms, or accessories as though to leave no identifying marks on his corpse. Calculatingly ordinary, yet striking eye-catching, depending on how he would choose to carry himself. Nothing about him was a mistake.

Lange breathed in. “This is a tailor shop, sir. If you are seeking custom attire, please tell me what sort of clothes you seek.”

After a blink the man turned his gaze down onto himself and gently tugged at his trousers. “My clothes, you imply, is inadequate?”

Lange inhaled quietly and squeezed his cheeks into a serviceman’s smile. “No sir. It is just that those who visit here seek new clothing, whether it be for a new person or for a new purpose.” It was a gamble – those who spoke between the words usually appreciated this kind of a thing.

Silence. A midnight silence where even the birds went to sleep. Lange almost started seeing whites in front of his eyes. Then: “I see. It is of my fault that I have not introduced myself.” The man smiled ever so faintly, creating levity – like the crack of a window in a smoke-filled room. “I may be known as Arex. I come seeking services of the Thirty-Seventh Hallow-Bearer.”

Lange breathed a sigh of relief. The man still held his domineering presence, but the name took the edge off his glare.

“Then I am afraid that you will not find it. She no longer provides any services as the Hero.”

“Is that so?” The man, Arex, lifted his chin ever so slightly. “And should her services be demanded?”

There was an implied threat within his words, but not in his delivery. Or at least, Lange decided to comprehend it that way.

“*Wisdom lies in the moment*.” He quotes the Teachings. “And I do not speak for her.”

The man tilted his head, and his eyebrows came together almost imperceptibly. “I see.”

More pause, more silence. Lange kept his eyes fixated on the man’s mouth, afraid of meeting his eyes directly, until the man ended their moment with a big inhale.

“Very well. I shalt return. Please do inform her that her services are demanded post-haste.”

The man gave his old Empyrean style farewell bow – then turned to leave, before stopping beside the scarves hanging next to the door. He pointed to one of them – thick cotton one in dull green, then asked, “For how much, do you sell this?”

Lange coughed, “Uh? Oh that… two silvers.”

The man reached into his sash and withdrew exactly two silvers, took the scarf and wrapped it around his neck, balanced the coins perfectly on top of the tip of the scarf stand, then vanished outside into the SUNlight.

It took a while for Lange to shake himself out of his stupor, and even while longer to pick up the coins.

…

“The Demon of the Red Blade has returned.”

Tal felt as though someone had stabbed him with an iced pick – right in his sternum, where his breath got stuck, forcing him to cough. He was not alone, as the rotunda was filled with disquieted mumbles and growls. They all waited for more, but Librarian simply clasped her hands and allowed the echoes to wash over her, as though relishing the taste of the emotions she had uncorked. Tal bit his inner cheeks, refusing to give her even a bubble of emotion.

“What are your sources, Red Librarian?” He spoke, his voice sounding a lot more composed than his heartbeat.

The elderly Dragon tilted her head, a glint of mischievous malice too easily readable from her eyelashes. “It is I.”

To his left, two rows up, hidden behind the flower-carved marble, the Dragons that were still groggy from their awakened hibernation looked on with a curious scowl, likely confused by the blatant disregard for the Order of this council – some would have known about the name ‘Demon’, but most were more likely just curious about the visibly elderly Dragon that seemed to never have hibernated in her life. Few rows further behind them, much higher up, the young ones with scarcely an Epitaph to their story reddened with annoyance. On the other side of the hall, far to the right, a few hurried shadows shuffled in and out of the windows, relaying the news despite its questionable veracity. Somewhere between the two, the largest and the silent majority, solidified their stern faces, their eyes darting between abject terror and outright anger. And finally, a select few Dragons behind the Librarian looked on with ashen emptiness, their faces prepared already for the war of expression.

“And you seek not to elaborate?” Tal spoke, tired already.

“Would you, were you wielding my words?” The Red Librarian spoke. She was facing his direction but was not speaking to him. Her eyes were instead focused on the symbol that floated above him – an obsidian pentagon transcribed inside a circle, the iris of the Order. The control over her gaze was miniscule and perfect – no-one else other than he would see. A declaration of war against the Speaker of the Order, but to no-one else. Almost the toss of the feather for a duel. Meaning that his tongue was tied to the rules of the chamber.

“I would, should I wish my agenda be inscribed upon the gem of this meeting.” Tal continued to maintain his static delivery, much to his own surprise.

The Red Librarian turned to scan the room; unhurriedly, methodically. Tal was reminded how much she and the Demon were alike. Tal, too, was amongst the few Dragons who knew the Demon before his epitaph. An amicable human, his posture balancing between arrogant and humble, and always commanding attention when he desired it. Even though almost four centuries had passed, it was clear that the Demon had left a lasting impression on his adoptive sister.

“Very well.” She sighed theatrically. “Then disregard my agenda. I have spoken what I believed was necessary.” Then she plopped herself down onto her cushioned seat, with a servant human managing to catch her from landing too hard.

Contrary to her casual conclusion, the room was instead filled with angry shouts as the silent majority shattered their surprise.

“Why would she make such baseless claims?”

“Her sources needed to be pried from her fingers!”

“Was she inciting violence for her amusement?”

“How could she disgrace the council?”

“Why was she even allowed to speak?”

Tal slammed the marble desk at the last comment, sending a reverberation of mana throughout the stones of the building. As much as he too wished to ask many of the same questions; “The Red Librarian represents the *Library*, and thus the sanctified duty of Recordkeeping. It is her rational right to bring up facts she deems important, and to protect those who hold the pen of her missives.” Tal turned to the Librarian. “Though I, as the Speaker to the Order, must condemn you for bringing facts that may be of explosive disposition without sufficiently worrying about the repercussions.”

The Red Librarian bowed her head, her eyes seeming to thank him for taking her side. He did not know how to feel about it. The Demon, too, was incredibly good at this game – of formalities and rules, forcing the Order to adhere to them while he himself bent them to his liking. Yet despite knowing he was manipulated, Tal did not feel the annoyance. Perhaps it was precisely because he was reminded of their younger days, of their shining golden age. And for the same reason, he fully understood why other Dragons now looked to the Red Librarian with murderous intent.

“I, as the Speaker to the Order, will henceforth rule this conversation thusly – the Red Librarian’s claims will be struck from the topics of today. Tomorrow, we shall speak again. Now, Incense of the Forest, it is your topic that shall be focused.”

The obsidian floor rippled away from the Red Librarian’s chair and soon came to the Incense of the Forest’ chair, illuminating it with a soft purple hue. The middle-aged Dragon stood up, seemingly slightly annoyed by having to speak after the Red Librarian. He stroked his well-groomed beard while waiting for people to focus on him, then spoke.

“Council of the SKY. I am Incense of the Forest, currently in charge of our relations with the Eternal Garden. I wish to share with you this: The adherents of the Eternal Garden appear to be forming another Expedition. This is yet but a rumor, though backed by the increased recall rate of their battle priests and their reduced usage of their god’s blessings, which aligns with their Expedition preparations protocol since the start of last century.” The man carefully scanned the distracted council and frowned slightly, “Though the Expedition itself is not of particular concern, there exists two points of interest. The first is the silence from the Botanarch, perhaps in violation of the Accord of the River, as she has yet to contact the Order before any action. However, if I may express my opinion-” the man quickly glanced at Tal, who nodded his approval “it appears to be caused by the second point of interest, which is the presence of an intruder in the Inner Sanctum of the Eternal Garden.”

Tal felt his lips twitch with displeasure. Had it not been for the Red Librarian’s overture, this news would have been significant to raise the eyebrows of some Council members. Alas, most were still whispering about the Demon of the Red Blade – the fate of the Apostate’s Hallow, the questions about the Third Red War, and such. Even those who looked to the Incense did not do so with full focus.

Tal let out a click of mana to wash over the room, temporarily bringing them back to the present topic.

“This news of the intruder is unconfirmed, especially as the eyes within the Gardens spoke none of it, but the Owner of the Sovereign’s Hallow confirmed that the Savior’s Hallow has been moved.”

At this, some of the older Dragons leaned forward in their seats. “Has been moved?”

Tal recognized this dragon as the Dictator of Dirt. From the memories Tal could access, this Dragon was a renowned Storm Chaser. Surreptitious, it was, for him to awaken upon the Demon’s alleged return.

“Yes. Whether this is indeed the work of an intruder, internal espionage, or a planned action, is unknown, but I have decided to relay this information as the work of an intruder due to the total embargo on information from the Eternal Garden.”

Satisfied that his turn had finished, the bearded Dragon bowed his head and sat down. The rest of the council were less noisy, with the flurry of news dying down into a low hum. Intelligence shared on the war of the west against the idolaters, the increasing strife in the Mian hierarchy, their current supply of gems and their new trade deals with the humans, and the next batch of Academia candidates. Tal kept half his eye on the Red Librarian, who sat her eyes closed, her face loosened with disinterest. And yet she stayed, along with her full entourage, at the very front row, carefully taking in all the news she could.

Had the Demon truly returned? If it was true, then a mere council such as this would not suffice, and the repercussions were far beyond for him to consider now. But then, why would she lie? A disquieted council benefited exceedingly few save for disruptors and newcomers. Perhaps the Red Librarian was thinking of her daughter? The venerable dragon was in her twilight years, after all. Or perhaps she had found another human to her liking – and was preparing to groom him like how her mother had done the Demon before. Not that another Demon would be born – Tal refused to entertain that idea – but they may be another who would attempt to steal away the Hallow for themselves.

Regardless of her true purpose, it was clear that today was her victory. And as knowing this to be true, the Red Librarian did not leave the room as a caucus was called. She merely watched on with unhidden bemusement as the Dragons left the room, responding to each stabbing glare with a cheerful smile.

She even gave Tal a knowing wink. One identical to the Demon, before leaving the room, feigning weakness into the arms of her human servant.

…

“Well, that’s not deeply concerning at all.” Leaf mumbled as he stirred the stew.

Lange’s mother raised her finger to prompt him to continue, but Lange simply shook his head. “That’s all.”

His mother nodded with her eyes remaining open but buried in her thoughts. She crossed her fingers and rested her chin on them. Leaf glanced across the kitchen, and Lange gave him a nervous shrug.

“Did… you meet that man?”

His mother shook her head. The earthen room was filled only with the sound of the boiling cauldron, and the aroma of meat did not quite find purchase in the serious air.

Lange stood up to make his way towards Leaf, who waved him to sit back down. He, too, seemed to be rattling his head to remember something.

“Hallow-Bearer is a term used by the Dragons, actually,” Leaf finally said. “And since I haven’t heard anything from the Garden… maybe one of the human lackies from the SKY?”

At this, his mother looked up. “You haven’t heard anything?”

Leaf shook his head. “No. Why?”

His mother continued to gaze into Leaf – a similar piercing gaze from that of the man. But her gaze was like that of a falcon’s; discerning lies from truth, and plucking up facts buried within. Despite the decade that has passed…

Lange shuddered.

“I trust you, Leaf.” His mother flicked her wrists, making it clear that her frown was not directed towards him at all. “If that’s the case…”

The three of them fell into silence, with Leaf making a fuss about tasting the soup. Lange thought that he had matured out of hating such silence, but he couldn’t help feeling his body feeling colder and colder with every passing minute. Without thinking, he let out a sigh – a whimper – of fear.

“Ah.” His mother shook her head and immediately relaxed her fingers. “I am sorry, Lange. I… allow me to think for a bit. I promise to say everything before bedtime.”

At this, Lange felt the tiniest bit of relief. “I can wait longer if you need.”

His mother forced a grin.

The dinner was fine. Good, even. They tried to talk about Leaf’s recent travels – it seemed that he had spent his past year in the Tolan Heights, doing commissions amidst their civil war. His elven heritage was apparently under annoying scrutiny there. Unfortunately, Leaf’s merry recounting of his travels was distracted by the silent topic that sat with them on the table. His mother at fault to constantly remind them – though she didn’t even seem to be aware that she was circling back to this topic – as she inquired about the Garden’s status in Tolan and any recent developments on Leaf’s duties. Nothing of particular note, was the answer – and this troubled her even more.

With their plates nearly empty, his mother finally pushed her plate to the side and clasped her hands. “Olein Galding.”

Leaf grimaced, closed his eyes, and straightened his back. “Karra Whitten.”

“State your position, and duty.”

Lange held his breath. All three of them already knew who Leaf was – a ‘spy’ from the Garden to keep an eye on his mother. A family friend-turned-spy-turned-irrelevant as the ‘Hero Karra Whitten’ relinquished all her influence. Even if she wanted to return to the Garden now, the decade of inaction would make her mother a non-threat against the High Botanists political power. Thus, Leaf’s yearly checking-in of their family had become a happy excuse to catch up on friends, rather than the surveillance of threats.

Or so she had promised. Had she once again broken her promise?

*No*. Lange shook his head.

She had earned his trust. At least, enough for him to wait for her explanation. So that meant that it was a declaration – and a threat – to Leaf.

Leaf’s lips twitched. It smiled briefly as though to answer with a joke, but he seemed to change his mind and returned to the gravitas present.

“I am the Bell upon the Door, whose duty is to ring against those who would disturb the peace of the Garden.” Leaf said. “A Bell who is happy instead to chime with the prowling cats and chirping birds.”

His mother smiled sadly. “I ask too much of you.”

“Nonsense. You are my Hero, after all.”

His mother let out a sigh. Lange stood up and closed the windows to stop the nonexistent eavesdroppers.

“Well?”

His mother stretched her neck, drawing out the last few moments to choose her words.

“Today, Keyholder of Kradia visited me. They wanted to ask if I would return as an instructor in the Eternal Garden to ‘teach the young ones about old stories’.”

At this, both Leaf and Lange exchanged looks of confusion. Keyholder of Kradia knew about his mother’s circumstances. To ask something like that was beyond rude – it was potentially dangerous to both her and his mother. But Lange also knew that she was a kind lady, whose devotion was only out done by her compassion. Even though he had not interacted with her personally, both his neighbors and the Kradian Gardeners loved her dearly. So that meant that this was no brash action, but a highly cautious interaction.

“A roundabout warning, as you have guessed.” His mother continued, mildly proud that Lange had noticed the nuances. “Something – I don’t know what – is going on among the Oeilians up high; something which requires my presence. Now–” She held up her hand, “I swear that such offers do not tempt me anymore.”

“I know.” Lange nodded.

“Thank you, Lange.” She smiled. “But most importantly, *they* should know that as well. Now, that man, Arex, asked for the thirty-*seventh*.”

Leaf continued her sentence. “A non-existent Hero, but based on what you describe of him, he isn’t the sort to make such a mistake…”

Lange felt his mouth dry up as things rapidly clicked into place. “Meaning that he was looking for the services of a new Hero.”

“And since you are the only other resident here… it appears that, for some reason, the Botanarchs have pointed to you, Lange.”

Lange felt icy panic run through his veins. Lange was chosen as one of the Heroes. They needed to convince Whitten to ensure it, old promises be damned. Keyholder did not approve and thus warned them.

He was being called upon, once again.

“We aren’t done.” Leaf mutters through gritted teeth.

“Indeed. Though driven by politics, a promise is a promise. The Botanarch gains little from breaking it, unless there was some third party that has forced her hand.”

“Arex.” Lange coughed.

“An Empyrean, did you say? So is the Mian Empire finally trying to attack the Holy City?” Leaf clenched his fist.

“Speculation, Leaf. Perhaps too big of a jump in inference. But it would be reasonable to guess it is a party at least on equivalent threat level.”

Lange felt his breath being caught beneath his chin and swallowed to clear it.

“Why… me?”

He and his mother locked their eyes together. There were some obvious answers for that question – the memories of their time in the Garden returned, tainted with anger and dread.

“It might not be you, but her.” Leaf clicks his tongue. “You’re might just be a leverage to get to her. But again, why?”

His mother sighed and slumped her shoulders. Then, with a weak grin, she joked, “Maybe I should finally tell you where my pile of gold is.”

Both Leaf and Lange smiled, though their faces could not sustain it for long. The room was filled with an irritated yet hesitant sense of dread.

“Well, what do we do?” Lange asked. He found that his hands had grown completely cold. And so had his toes. He attempted to wiggle some blood back into his extremities.

“*In face of uncertainty, return to certainty.*” His mother quoted the Teachings. “The Keyholder wanted to warn me about *something*. What that is, we do not know. This man called Arex was looking for the thirty-seventh Hallowbearer living in this house. Whether he was mistaken or not, we do not know.”

“It’s an exceedingly small amount of information to work with.” Leaf grumbled. “But do we have the luxury to gather the rumors? If the Keyholder wanted to warn us about something, whatever *that* is, it will arrive very soon.”

“And it is not in my nature to simply wait.” His mother nodded. “So, I propose the following: Lange, could I ask you to disappear for a while? Perhaps a week, hopefully no longer.” Lange raised his eyebrows. “I will, meanwhile, attempt to send out some letters. I do not expect a reply from all of them, but surely, a certain few will return. If it turns out that nothing happens, then you would have had a nice holiday. But if it turns out that there are bad winds blowing, at least they won’t be able to get to you.”

Lange frowned. “But what about you?”

His mother smiled, with vitality returning to her cheeks. “Are you worried for me, or about me?”

Lange smiled, glad to see that she was feeling confident enough to joke. “Hmm. Maybe both.”

She laughed. “I will be fine, Lange, as long as you are safe. And on that point,” she faced Leaf. “Could I ask you to accompany him, Leaf?”

Leaf tilted his head in thought. “Hmm. I do know how to keep him away from the Keyholders. And if we are caught, I can claim that he had never really left my sight. The excuse won’t convince anyone, but it will at least be something to write paper.”

“Wait, but then they might use that as an excuse to punish you!”

Leaf waved his hand. “Ha! They should have punished me long ago.”

“For one week. And if nothing happens, we come back home with a sheepish tale to tell. If something does happen…, well, we will find out easily from the Garden’s criers.” His mother nodded. “What do you think, Lange?”

Lange hesitated to reply. “I… can’t ask you two to do this. If anything goes wrong, I won’t be the one in trouble…”

“That’s what friends are for!” Leaf grinned.

“And that is what a mother does for her son.”

Lange felt tears well up and shook himself back to the present and failed to hold in his tears. The night ended in an awkward hug between the three of them.

And not too long after, the new night began, with Lange beginning his hike away from Kradia. He looked back one last time before crossing the bridge, imagining that his mother was still at the window. Perhaps she was, perhaps she wasn’t.

Regardless, he turned around, and walked into the crisp darkness behind Leaf.
