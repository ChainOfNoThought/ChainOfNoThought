The man closed his eyes tilted his head towards the SKY to feel, or to imagine feeling, the tingle of warmth against the fuzz of his cheeks. The SUNlight that should have fallen from somewhere far above, filtered through the opaque-orange leaves of the giant autumn tree, and onto the floor of the dirt and Inner Sanctum here, where he had stood. However, he felt no warmth on his skin. The walled stone and false lights that illuminated the roots of the Golden Tree could only muster a draft of damp underground musk. Not that the serenity of the room was lost on him: The amber glow that came from the inscriptions of litanies were carved into the floor. The flickerless illumination of manalamps eternally enveloped the scattered chairs in deep contemplative light. A single beam of imitation SUNlight fell from the high ceilings and onto the statue of the kneeling woman. The First Gardener of the Golden Tree. A brilliant distillation of the faith of the worshippers. Another place that would soon to be forgotten in the quiet part of his memory.

A gargle interrupted his thoughts. Below. Next to his feet. A woman lay dying. The blow had caved in her breastplate – a thick sturdy metal inlaid with the verses and hymns was now but a deadly vice that crushed her ribs and puncturing her lungs. Her eyes were open. What did they say? A whispering prayer for salvation? A desperate cry against the encroaching eternity? A spitting rage at the thing that tore open her flesh? All of the above, or none of the above? He watched as intently as he could, but even as her eyes began to fade, he did not hear a single word.

“Save her.”

The man’s hands grasped the vulnerable gap beneath the woman’s armpits. With mechanical precision he pried open the metal coffin. The smell of blood filled the air. In his lungs. In her mouth. On his hands. In her chest. Gargling, sputtering. The words spoken with her eyes soon congealed into the singular emotion. Her eyes dimmed as her bloodied mouth mumbled the final words of prayer. A plea to her God: That her soul may-

He laid his hand on her breast. His fingers twitched as a singular command passed through his fingertips and into her heart.

*Live*.

And so, she obeyed. Her heart began to beat, strong yet steady. Her lungs began to expand and contract, pushing past the dead fluids, passing gas, and reinvigorating the flesh. The blood that was where they should not returned to where they should. Live, was the command. And live, she did. The woman coughed. Then drew breath on her own. Then she looked up at him, her eyes regaining the living light but marred with muddied emotions. Confusion, pain, a hint of gratitude – and a deep sense of betrayal. Life. And wrath.

Another woman, clad in the same armor but with eyes of calmer waters, came to his side.

“Does not the weight of your vows compel your hand?”

The man looked over his shoulder. The scattered metal, blood, and stone replied for him. The woman read the direction of his eyes, grunted with disapproval, then returned to her place near the entrance of the sanctuary, taking position between the bent steel doors that barely hung onto their hinges. She closed her eyes and planted her halberd in front of her – facing him. “I shall not remind you next time.”

He nodded and stood up, leaving the living woman to finish carrying out his command.

Now, he faced the alter. And a statue that stood on top of it. One step. Then another. Then stop. Below the statue’s gaze. A smile of empty eyes and subjectless blessings. Upon her outstretched hands lay a sword, wrapped in layers of ribbons inlaid with prayers. The man tugged at one of the loose ribbons and read its letters, but did not recognize any of the stories it regaled.

“Poems of past Heroes; the Hallow Bearers who defeated the Devil,” The woman at the doorway muttered, “The empty one at the pommel waits for the next story.”

A single golden ribbon was thread through the ringed pommel of the Hallow. He pulled out the ribbon, then examined its length – longer than his legs, and as thick as two fingers. It was smooth to his touch and seemed to shiver to his heartbeat.

He let it drop to the floor.

His eyes returned once again to the statue – the First Gardener, the Great Teacher, the Compassionate, and many monikers he did not care to remember. The features of the face were familiar yet unfamiliar at once. She was indeed recognizable; the sculptor had clearly met the First Gardener in the flesh – but their hands were motivated by the desires of a masterpiece, not the faithfulness to truth; they had carved her with perfect divinity, but nothing else. Not her laughter, not her cries, not her questions.

He unsheathed the Hallow from its ribboned scabbard, tearing the numerous strips that got caught in the cross guard. The metallic thing hummed under his fingers, a greeting rather than protest. It sang when he raised the blade above his head and echoed when it sliced through the neck of the stone.

In the distance, echoing down the hallways behind her back, the sound of heavy boots and clanging weapons disrupted the serenity of the defiled sanctum.

“Why?” The woman asked.

“A question,” The man replied. He returned the blade and let it rest on the stump of the neck.

*Live.*

And so, the statue obeyed. The stone began to shiver and grow – a spine of bone began to emerge from the cut. At first, a little stub, then a puzzle piece of growing and curving granite bones and marble joints, a fork of two ribcages, each with an arm and a leg that joined back together, then split into skulls for hands and feet, and more femurs and spines that spewed forth. The man watched as the indecipherable stone corpse continued to extrude itself from the neck of the First Gardener, forming a creature that reached almost to the ceiling. Where it had its limbs or head was hard to tell, but soon it curled up into a cage of bone and marble flesh, engulfing the statue and the altar. The man stepped back, picked up the severed head off the floor, and placed it between on the hands of the outstretched skeletal arms. A crown of fingers sprang out and pulled the head into its folds. The woman on the ground, commanded by the same word, groaned in horror as a monstrosity filled the most sacred space of the Eternal Garden.

The woman’s ears instinctively twitched, reacting to the increasingly louder clangs of disciplined boots slamming against the stone floor.

“A question of open formulation?” The woman lifted her weapon off the ground and balanced it across her torso. The edge of the weapon held straight – and pointed at the heart of the man.

“I never claimed to have the answers.” The man replied. He too, lifted his weapon. The Hallow pointed way from the alter, away from the roots of the Golden Tree, away from the growing corpse of stone, away from the ruined serenity of the stone architecture.

It pointed towards where he was looking.
