The storm hit just after sunset, turning the world into a chaos of wind and water.

Maya had barely finished reading through her father's recent log entries when the first gust shook the cottage. The windows rattled in their frames, and somewhere above, the lighthouse groaned like a living thing.

She grabbed her father's rain slicker from its hook—it smelled of salt and tobacco, achingly familiar—and stepped out into the tempest.

## The Keeper's Duty

The path to the lighthouse door was treacherous in good weather. In a storm, it was nearly impossible. Maya fought her way up, rain driving horizontally into her face, wind trying to tear her from the narrow track.

The lighthouse door slammed shut behind her, cutting off the howl of the storm. In the sudden quiet, she could hear her own ragged breathing and the steady tick-tick-tick of the clockwork mechanism that turned the light.

She climbed.

The spiral stairs seemed endless, each step taking her further from the ground, closer to whatever truth her father had hidden in this tower. His logs had grown increasingly cryptic in his final months:

*March 15 - They're louder during the equinox.*

*April 2 - Found another ship. Or what's left of one. 1847 by the nameplate. How many more?*

*May 30 - Maya's birthday. God help her.*

## The Lamp Room

At the top, the lamp room blazed with light. The Fresnel lens turned steadily, each facet catching and throwing the beam out across the storm-tossed sea. Maya had to shield her eyes as she approached.

That's when she saw them.

Ships. Dozens of them, scattered across the water like toys. But these weren't real vessels—she could see through them, ghost ships sailing through the storm as if the last century hadn't happened. Schooners and steamships, fishing boats and frigates, all of them heading straight for the island.

And the light was turning them away.

Each sweep of the beam sent them spinning back into the darkness, an endless dance of approach and repulsion. Maya pressed her face to the glass, trying to understand what she was seeing.

"Beautiful, aren't they?"

She spun around. A man stood by the lens, but like the ships, she could see through him. He wore the uniform of a lighthouse keeper from another era, brass buttons tarnished with age.

"Who are you?"

"Josiah Whitmore," he said, tipping his cap. "Keeper from 1891 to 1923. Your father never mentioned us?"

"Us?"

More figures materialized from the shadows. Men and women in period dress, all bearing the unmistakable look of those who had spent their lives tending the light.

"Every keeper stays," Josiah explained. "It's part of the bargain. We keep the light burning, and the light keeps them out there."

Maya's mind reeled. "What are they?"

"The lost ones. The hungry ones. Ships that never made it home, and worse things that wear their shapes." Josiah's face was grave. "This island sits on a thin place, Miss Chen. A boundary. Without the light..."

He didn't need to finish. Maya could see it in the desperate way the ghost ships pressed against the barrier of light, could feel their hunger even from here.

## The Bargain

"My father knew about this?"

"Knew about it? Girl, he was the best keeper we've had in fifty years. Could feel a breach coming days in advance. Reinforced the barriers before every storm." Josiah's expression softened. "He talked about you constantly. Worried about bringing you into this."

"But he did anyway."

"Had no choice. The lighthouse chooses its keeper, and it chose you long ago. Why do you think you left? It wasn't time yet. But now..."

The storm intensified, and Maya saw several ghost ships surge forward, closer than before. The light pushed them back, but barely.

"What do I have to do?"

Josiah smiled sadly. "What every keeper does. Tend the light. Learn the patterns. Keep the darkness at bay." He gestured to the other spirits. "We'll help, as we helped your father. But the burden is yours."

Maya looked out at the storm, at the endless parade of lost souls seeking landfall. She thought of her life in Boston, her apartment, her job, everything she'd built away from this place.

Then she thought of her father, alone in this tower for forty years, keeping his terrible vigil.

"Show me," she said.

## The First Lesson

Josiah led her to the lens mechanism. "The light must never go out. Not for a second. The oil must be maintained, the clockwork wound, the lens cleaned. But that's just the physical part."

He placed his translucent hand over hers on the brass controls. "Feel the rhythm. The lighthouse has a heartbeat. Match yours to it."

Maya closed her eyes, and suddenly she could feel it—a deep thrumming that seemed to come from the island itself. Her own pulse slowed, synchronized, and when she opened her eyes, the world looked different.

She could see the barriers now, walls of light extending from the lighthouse in all directions. Could see the weak spots where the ghost ships pressed hardest. Could see the things that weren't ships at all, writhing in the darkness beyond.

"Good," Josiah said. "You're a natural. Just like your father."

The storm raged on, but Maya stood steady in the lamp room, surrounded by the keepers who had come before. She was no longer Maya Chen, software developer from Boston.

She was the Keeper of Sorrow's End Light.

And the darkness would not pass on her watch.
