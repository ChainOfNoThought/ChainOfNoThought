The letter arrived on a Tuesday, salt-stained and smelling of the sea.

Maya Chen had been living in Boston for fifteen years, had built a life of subway schedules and coffee shops, of concrete and glass that never moved. She'd almost forgotten that she came from a place where the horizon shifted with the tides, where houses groaned in sympathy with the wind.

Almost.

The envelope bore no return address, just her name in spidery handwriting that made her heart clench with recognition. Inside, a single sheet of paper and a brass key worn smooth by decades of handling.

*Maya,*

*The lighthouse is yours now. You'll know what to do.*

*Keep the light burning.*

*-Dad*

She read it three times before the words sank in. Her father was dead. Had been dead, according to the date on the letter, for nearly two weeks. No one had called. No one had thought to tell his only daughter that Samuel Chen, keeper of Sorrow's End Light for forty years, had finally let his own flame go out.

## The Journey Back

The ferry to Sorrow's End ran twice a week, weather permitting. Maya stood at the rail, watching the mainland shrink behind her, trying to remember the last time she'd made this journey. Ten years? Twelve? The guilt sat heavy in her stomach, mixing uneasily with the roll of the waves.

"You're Sam's girl," the ferryman said. It wasn't a question. "Sorry for your loss. He was a good man. Stubborn as hell, but good."

Maya nodded, not trusting her voice. Around her neck, the lighthouse key hung on a chain, cold against her skin despite the summer sun.

## First Glimpse

Sorrow's End appeared through the fog like something from a dream, or a nightmare. The lighthouse stood on the island's highest point, its red brick tower rising 150 feet above the churning Atlantic. Even in daylight, she could see the beam sweeping across the water, faithful as a heartbeat.

The cottage huddled at the lighthouse's base looked exactly as she remembered: white clapboard walls, blue shutters, roses growing wild around the door. As if she'd never left. As if the last fifteen years had been the dream, and this was the awakening.

The ferry's horn sounded, mournful in the fog. There was no dock at Sorrow's Endâ€”there never had been. Supplies and visitors had to be brought ashore by smaller boats, everything subject to the whims of tide and weather.

"You sure about this?" the ferryman asked as she climbed down into the dinghy. "Storm coming in tonight. Might be stuck out there for a while."

Maya gripped her single suitcase, feeling the weight of the key around her neck. "I'm sure."

But as the dinghy cut through the dark water toward shore, as the lighthouse beam swept over them like a searching eye, she wasn't sure of anything at all.

## The Lighthouse Keeper's Daughter

The cottage door opened at her touch, unlocked as always. Inside, everything was exactly where her father had left it. His coffee mug on the kitchen table. His jacket on the hook by the door. The lighthouse log open on the desk, the last entry dated two weeks ago, the day he died.

Maya picked up the log, running her fingers over his careful handwriting:

*June 21 - Summer Solstice  
Wind: NE 15 knots  
Visibility: 2 miles, fog  
Light: Operational  
Notes: They're getting restless. She'll be here soon.*

A chill ran down her spine. Who were "they"? And had he known she was coming?

Outside, the fog pressed against the windows like something alive. The lighthouse beam continued its endless sweep, and Maya realized with a start that someone must have been tending it. The light couldn't run for two weeks on its own.

She climbed the spiral stairs to the lamp room, her footsteps echoing in the hollow tower. At the top, the Fresnel lens turned slowly, casting rainbows across the walls. Beautiful and terrible, just as she remembered.

But there was something else. Something she didn't remember.

Scratched into the brass plate at the base of the lens were words that made her blood run cold:

*SOME LIGHTS WARN  
SOME LIGHTS GUIDE  
SOME LIGHTS BIND*

And below that, in her father's hand:

*May God forgive me for what I've kept at bay.*

The lighthouse beam swept across the darkening sea, and Maya finally understood why no one had called when her father died. Why the letter had taken two weeks to reach her. Why she was the only one who could take his place.

The lighthouse wasn't just a beacon.

It was a barrier.

And she was its new keeper.
