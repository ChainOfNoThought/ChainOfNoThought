---

The storm passed just before dawn, leaving behind a beach littered with impossible things.

Maya stood at the cottage window, exhausted from her night's vigil, watching the first pale light reveal the aftermath. The beach, usually pristine sand and scattered shells, was covered in debris. But this wasn't ordinary driftwood and seaweed.

Ship wheels from vessels that had sunk centuries ago. Figureheads with faces twisted in eternal screams. Chains that seemed to writhe when she wasn't looking directly at them.

"First storm always brings gifts," Josiah said from behind her. She'd gotten used to his sudden appearances, the way the ghost keepers flickered in and out of visibility. "Your father called it the tithe. The sea giving back what it's taken."

"Should I... collect them?"

"Best not to touch anything yet. Let the sun burn off the worst of it. Some things that wash up aren't meant for human hands."

## The Journal

While waiting for full daylight, Maya returned to her father's study. She'd found his personal journal hidden behind the official lighthouse logs, and its contents were far more disturbing than the dry records of weather and maintenance.

*October 12, 1995*
*Maya's tenth birthday. She saw them today. The ships. Told her it was just fog playing tricks, but she knew. The lighthouse is already calling to her. Margaret wants to leave, take Maya away from here. Maybe she's right.*

Maya's hands trembled. She barely remembered that birthday, just fragments—her mother's tight smile, her father's worried looks, and yes, the ships in the fog that everyone said weren't there.

*December 3, 1995*
*Margaret left. Took Maya. Can't blame her. This is no life for a child. The keepers say Maya will return when it's time, that the lighthouse won't let her stay away forever. God help me, I hope they're wrong.*

She flipped forward, years passing in pages.

*June 1, 2010*
*The barriers are weakening. Each storm brings them closer. I've reinforced what I can, but I'm one man, and I'm getting old. Josiah says it's happened before—every few generations, the darkness grows stronger. We need a new keeper soon. Young blood. Strong blood.*

*June 20, 2024*
*I can feel it coming. My time. The lighthouse hums differently now, like it's calling someone home. Maya, forgive me. I've left you a burden no father should leave his child. But you're the only one who can do this. The blood knows. The blood always knows.*

## The Beach

When the sun was fully up, Maya ventured onto the beach. Up close, the debris was even stranger. A ship's compass that pointed to no earthly direction. Books written in languages that hurt to look at. Bottles containing messages that seemed to whisper when the wind passed over them.

She was examining a barnacle-encrusted clock that ticked backward when she heard footsteps on the sand. She turned, expecting to see another ghost.

Instead, a very alive woman stood twenty feet away, wearing practical clothes and a wary expression. She looked to be in her fifties, weathered by sun and salt.

"You're Sam's daughter," the woman said. "Maya."

"Yes. And you are?"

"Ellen Morse. I run supplies out from the mainland. Been bringing your father groceries and lamp oil for twenty years." She looked at the debris-strewn beach and shook her head. "Hell of a first storm."

"You know about... all this?"

Ellen snorted. "Hard not to, doing supply runs to haunted lighthouses. Your father kept me out of the worst of it, but I've seen enough." She pulled a notebook from her pocket. "Speaking of supplies, here's what you'll need for the week. Same order your father always placed."

Maya took the list, grateful for something normal and practical. "How often do you come?"

"Weather permitting? Twice a week. Storm season, might be longer between runs." Ellen studied her. "You planning to stay?"

"I don't think I have a choice."

"There's always a choice. Your mother made hers." Ellen's expression softened. "But I'm glad you're here. Your father... toward the end, he was struggling. The light needs someone strong."

"How long was he alone out here?"

"Since your mother left? Near thirty years. Had us for company when we could make it out, and the ghosts of course, but..." She shrugged. "It's a lonely life, keeping the light."

## The Discovery

After Ellen left, promising to return Thursday with supplies, Maya continued her exploration of the beach. Near the tide line, she found something that made her heart stop.

A piece of metal, partially buried in the sand. She brushed it clean and found herself looking at a bronze nameplate: *USS Cyclops*.

She knew that name. Everyone who grew up near the sea knew it. The USS Cyclops had vanished in the Bermuda Triangle in 1918, taking 306 souls with her. No trace had ever been found.

Until now.

"Ah," Josiah materialized beside her. "You found one of the far travelers."

"This ship disappeared a thousand miles from here."

"Distance doesn't mean the same thing in the dark places," Josiah said. "Things that vanish in one thin spot sometimes wash up in another. Your father kept a catalog. Three rooms in the cottage basement, full of pieces of impossible ships."

Maya stared at the nameplate. How many ships had ended up here? How many mysteries of the sea had their answer on this tiny island?

"What am I supposed to do with them?"

"Bear witness," Josiah said simply. "Someone should know where they ended up. Someone should remember."

## The Pattern

That night, Maya climbed the lighthouse stairs with new understanding. The lamp room felt different now—less foreign, more like coming home. She checked the oil levels, wound the clockwork mechanism, polished the lens until it gleamed.

The ghost keepers appeared one by one, nodding approval. Besides Josiah, there was Catherine Walsh (keeper 1923-1946), Erik Nordstrom (1946-1971), and her father's immediate predecessor, Robert Clearwater (1971-1984).

"You're learning quickly," Catherine said. "Faster than most."

"It feels... familiar," Maya admitted. "Like I've done this before."

"Blood memory," Erik explained. "The lighthouse changes those who tend it. Gets into your bones, your genes. Why keeper families often produce more keepers."

Maya thought of her father's journal, his mention of blood knowing. "Are there other lighthouses like this?"

"A few," Robert answered. "Scattered around the world where the boundaries are thin. We keep in touch, after a fashion. Share knowledge. Share warnings."

"Warnings about what?"

The keepers exchanged glances. Finally, Josiah spoke. "Every few generations, something tests the barriers. Something big. Your father thought the next test was coming soon."

Maya looked out at the dark sea, where ghost ships circled endlessly. "How will I know?"

"Oh, child," Catherine said softly. "You'll know."

As if in response to her words, the lighthouse beam flickered. Just for a second, but in that second, Maya saw something massive moving beneath the water. Something that dwarfed the ghost ships.

Something that had been waiting.

The beam steadied, and it was gone. But Maya knew it would be back. The test was coming, and she was the only thing standing between the darkness and the world.

She checked the oil again, polished a spot she'd missed on the lens, and settled in for another long night.

The Keeper of Sorrow's End Light was on duty.
