The dame walked into my office at 2 AM, and I knew she was trouble before she opened her mouth.

In Mnemonic, you learn to read people by what they're trying to forget. She had that look—too much makeup around the eyes, shoulders held like she was carrying invisible weight, fingers that wouldn't stop moving. Classic signs of someone with memories they couldn't live with.

"Mr. Cain?" Her voice was whiskey and smoke. "I need something stolen."

I leaned back in my chair, studying her. Expensive coat, cheap shoes. Real pearls, fake wedding ring. A story there, but in my line of work, everyone had a story.

"Lady, I'm a memory thief, not a pickpocket. You want someone's jewelry lifted, try the docks."

"I don't want jewelry." She sat down uninvited, crossing her legs. "I want you to steal a memory. From me."

## The Pitch

Now that was interesting. Most people went to the legal extractors for personal removals. Clean, safe, licensed. Coming to someone like me meant she wanted something the legitimate memory merchants wouldn't touch.

"Which one?" I asked, pulling out my case of vials. Empty glass containers lined up like soldiers, each one waiting to hold someone's past.

"The night my husband died."

I set the case down carefully. "Murder?"

"The police said suicide." The way she said it told me everything I needed to know about what the police didn't know.

"Look, Miss..."

"Sinclair. Vera Sinclair."

"Miss Sinclair, removing traumatic memories is tricky business. Take out the wrong thread and your whole sense of self can unravel. Why not go to a licensed—"

"Because a licensed extractor would have to report certain... details to the authorities." She opened her purse, pulled out a roll of bills thick enough to choke a horse. "I'm not asking you to judge. I'm asking you to steal."

## The Rules

I'd been in the memory business for ten years, ever since the war ended and they declassified the extraction tech. Started legitimate, working for the Memory Bureau, helping trauma victims and witnesses. But legitimacy in Mnemonic was like morning fog—pretty while it lasted, gone by noon.

"There are rules," I said, though the money was already making me stupid. "I can't take more than 24 hours at a time. Can't touch core memories—first kiss, mother's face, that sort of thing. And I can't guarantee what else might come with it. Memories are messy. They bleed into each other."

"I understand the risks."

"Do you? Because once it's gone, it's gone. I bottle it up, and that piece of your life becomes just another vial on my shelf. You'll know something happened—there'll be a gap, like a missing tooth. But you won't know what."

She lit a cigarette with shaking hands. In the flare of the match, I saw her face clearly for the first time. Beautiful, but it was a brittle beauty, like ice before it cracks.

"That's the point, Mr. Cain. I need to not know."

## The Setup

My extraction rig took up most of the back room. Pre-war tech, ugly as sin but reliable. The chair looked like something from a dentist's nightmare, all leather straps and copper wiring. The helmet—a tangle of electrodes and glass tubes—hung from the ceiling like a mechanical spider.

Vera settled into the chair without hesitation. Either very brave or very desperate. In my experience, there wasn't much difference.

"Tell me about that night," I said, adjusting the electrodes. "I need to locate the memory before I can extract it."

"December 15th. Three months ago. We were at home—the penthouse on Memory Lane." She laughed, bitter. "Ironic address, considering. Richard had been drinking. He'd been drinking a lot since..."

"Since?"

"Since he found out about the affair."

I attached the last electrode. "His or yours?"

"Does it matter now?"

It did, but I didn't push. In the memory game, you learned when to dig and when to let sleeping secrets lie.

"Think about that night," I instructed, powering up the rig. "Start from when you got home. Focus on the details—what you wore, what you smelled, what you heard. The machine needs anchors."

She closed her eyes. "I wore the blue dress. The one he bought me in Paris, before everything went wrong. The apartment smelled like his cigars and... and something else. Gunpowder."

The extraction helmet hummed to life, glass tubes beginning to glow with a soft phosphorescence. Inside them, wisps of memory began to condense, silver and ethereal like captured moonlight.

"He was in his study," she continued, her voice growing distant as the machine pulled her deeper. "The door was locked. I knocked, but he wouldn't answer. I could hear him talking to someone, but when I finally got in..."

"Yes?"

"He was alone. Just him and his father's service revolver and... and..."

The memory stream in the tubes suddenly turned dark, swirling with reds and blacks. Violent memories always came out like that, stained with emotion too strong to distill clean.

"That's enough," I said, but something was wrong. The machine was pulling too hard, the memory fighting extraction. In the tubes, I could see fragments—a man's face twisted in anger, a gun falling from limp fingers, but also something else. Shadows that moved wrong. Figures that shouldn't have been there.

"Miss Sinclair, I need you to—"

Her eyes snapped open, but they weren't seeing me. "He wasn't alone," she whispered. "Oh god, he wasn't alone. They were there. In the walls. In the mirrors. Watching. They've always been watching."

The machine screamed, overloading. I lunged for the emergency shutoff, but it was too late. The memory tore free—not just the night her husband died, but something larger, something that had been hiding beneath.

In the glass tubes, a complete memory swirled, darker than any I'd ever seen. And in its depths, eyes opened. Dozens of them, staring out at me from inside the captured past.

"What did you do?" I grabbed Vera's shoulders as she slumped forward. "What the hell were you really trying to forget?"

She looked up at me, tears streaming down her face, but also relief. "I hired you to steal a memory, Mr. Cain. I never said it was mine."

The vial in my hand pulsed with alien darkness. And somewhere in the city, something that had been sleeping in the spaces between memories began to wake up.

I'd been played. And in Mnemonic, when you're holding someone else's nightmare in a bottle, you've only got two choices: pour it out and let it loose, or drink it down and make it yours.

Either way, I was about to learn why some memories are better left buried.

The dame had been trouble, all right.

She just wasn't the kind I'd expected.
