God is dead.

It is difficult to understate the profundity of the observation made by Frederick Nietzsche on my worldview. At first, the statement provided me a sneering sense of superiority over those who spent their hours in worship of a god that never spoke, or walked a path that could never, nor would ever, be reached. The annoyance and the anger at those who claimed to know truth and virtue and yet acted with both blindfolds and gags – the declaration that God was dead became an act of triumphant, sneering, vengeance. But then came nihilism.

It wasn’t some epiphany or an event that brought about nihilism. It would be convenient to claim that my near-death experiences catalyzed these thoughts, but deep down I know that it is, too is a lie. My life is not a story by a bard of legends, but a tale told by an idiot. And thus, there is no dramatic throughline that I can regale – it merely signifies nothing. Only that, at some point in my life I had come across the concept of nihilism and became enraptured by it.

Luckily, I was not predisposed to despair. Likely it was the fortune of being in relative material wealth, surrounded by an endlessly loving and forever supportive family. Thus, nihilism approached me as a question – the one truly serious philosophical problem, if you will. What was the point of it all? Living in three different continents throughout my youth, I had the fortune of breaking bread with the followers from vastly different religions of the world and listened to their claimed answers. Not that I believed they held any; but I still listened with sincerity, hoping to gain morsels of enlightenment.

It did not take long for me to realize that they too had triumphant declarations, used to sneer at those who were still lost. The absurdity of the blind idiot god whose random rolls of dice created the Big Bang, life, humanity, and the world. The compartmentalization of ‘Science’ being a god of the past who could offer no guidance to the future. The great calm in knowing that there is something more beyond the mote of dust, suspended in the sunbeam, against the backdrop of infinite nothingness.

To many whom I respect, they spoke in rapturous words how faith was a shield against the traumatic exercise of *momento** mori*. There was no death, but God. The eternal future was promised, bright, and in peace. All that required to glimpse towards this paradise was blind Faith.

Unfortunately, I had quite the poor eyesight – and thus I squinted, blind to the light of Truth, but not blind enough to the embrace of Truth. Within the hazy darkness that was the future, all I could see was death – the promise of total obliteration. Thus, I return to the statement, no longer with red-cheeked smugness but with hollow-eyed terror. God is dead. Where then, do I go now.

Others latch onto ‘solutions’ – the seductive ambrosia of digital transcendence; the lifelines of romance and companionship bound at the heart; the flip-book distractions of drugs, sex, and violence; the solitary march step of the Ubermensch; the single drop of water in the ocean satisfied in its eternal cycle. All, another name for ‘Faith’, though they refuse to call it as such. In the end, when all goes cold, and the last moments come, I know I will look onto death and will know fear.

For God, too, has died. And so, I shall join him, in no kingdom nor heaven.

Or so is the rational conclusion of one who believes nought but the exact mundanity of existence: That there is death, and that will be the end. And nothing can ever matter. There is some perverse comfort in such finality; the resignation to the traumatic face of the abyss as it stares back, unflinching. A deeply arrogant sense of superiority that I, alone, can look upon death with open eyes.

And I see nothing.

It is my deepest hope that my eyesight is terribly short. And that, tied to this cave called life, the nothingness I see is but a flickering shadow on the wall. One day, I pray that I may be free of these chains and see something – *something* – beyond.

But for now, I do not. Thus, in resignation, terror, duty, and hypocrisy, I raise my cup of madness in memory of God.
