Time moves in circles, not lines. Memory proves this with every déjà vu, every moment that feels like it has happened before.

We like to think of our lives as narratives with clear beginnings and endings, but memory doesn't work that way. It pools and eddies, creating strange currents where past and present merge.

## The River of Time

Yesterday, I walked past a bakery and the smell of fresh bread transported me twenty years backward. Suddenly I was eight years old again, standing in my grandmother's kitchen, watching her knead dough with practiced hands.

This is how memory works - not as a filing cabinet with neat chronological folders, but as a vast ocean where everything exists simultaneously. The past isn't behind us; it's within us, ready to surface at the slightest provocation.

## Circular Narratives

Perhaps this is why we tell the same stories over and over, why certain themes recur in our lives like musical motifs. We're not moving forward so much as spiraling outward, revisiting the same points from slightly different angles each time.

The ancient Greeks had two words for time: *chronos* (chronological time) and *kairos* (the right or opportune moment). While we live in chronos, we remember in kairos - those perfect moments that transcend their temporal boundaries and become eternal.

## The Persistence of Now

What does it mean that a memory from decades ago can feel more real than what happened yesterday? That we can close our eyes and be somewhere else entirely, somewhen else entirely?

Maybe it means that linear time is just a convenient fiction, a way of organizing experience that helps us navigate but doesn't reflect the true nature of consciousness. In our minds, all moments exist simultaneously, a constellation of experiences that we can navigate at will.

And so we drift, not forward through time but across it, like boats on a vast sea where every shore is equally present, equally distant, equally home.
