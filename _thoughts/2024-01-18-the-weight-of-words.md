Words carry more than meaning; they carry the weight of every time they've been spoken, every context they've inhabited.

## Etymology as Archaeology

To trace a word back to its roots is to perform a kind of archaeology, digging through layers of usage and meaning. The word "nostalgia" once meant the physical pain of homesickness, a medical condition that could kill. Now it's the bittersweet ache we feel scrolling through old photos.

How did we get from there to here? What does it say about us that we've transformed a word for potentially fatal homesickness into something almost pleasant?

## The Sediment of Language

Every word we use has been shaped by millions of mouths, carved by countless contexts. When I say "love," I'm not just expressing my own feeling - I'm invoking every poem, every song, every whispered confession that has ever used that word.

This is both the power and the limitation of language. We can never say anything truly original because our words come pre-loaded with history. But we can also tap into that vast reservoir of human experience, connecting our individual moments to the great continuum of human expression.

## Silence Between Words

Perhaps this is why poetry matters - it pays attention not just to words but to the silence between them, the white space that gives language room to breathe. In that space, new meanings can emerge, old words can shed their skin and reveal something unexpected underneath.

The Japanese have a word, "ma," for this meaningful emptiness. It's the pause in conversation that says more than words, the blank space in a painting that defines the subject. In English, we have no equivalent, which perhaps says something about our relationship with silence, with the unsaid.

## Writing as Excavation

When we write, we're not just putting words on a page. We're excavating meaning from the bedrock of language, chipping away at the accumulated sediment of centuries to find something that feels true, that resonates with the tuning fork of our experience.

Sometimes we succeed. Sometimes a phrase clicks into place with the satisfying snap of recognition, and we know we've found it - not something new, but something eternal dressed in contemporary clothes.

And sometimes we fail, and the words lie flat on the page, refusing to rise, refusing to carry the weight we're trying to place on them.

But we keep trying, because what else is there? We are creatures of language, and even our silence is defined by the words we choose not to say.
